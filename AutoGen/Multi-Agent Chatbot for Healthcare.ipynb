    "AutoMed is not just an ordinary chatbot—it’s a multi-agent AI system powered by AG2 (AutoGen), designed to simulate expert medical consultation through intelligent collaboration. Instead of relying on a single AI agent, AutoMed orchestrates multiple specialized agents, each dedicated to a specific task, ensuring comprehensive, accurate, and real-time medical guidance. By leveraging AutoGen’s multi-agent capabilities, AutoMed mimics the behavior of a real medical team, where different AI agents collaborate to analyze symptoms, suggest treatments, fetch real-time medical data, and provide follow-up care.\n",
    "\n",
    "With its adaptive intelligence and multi-agent communication, AutoMed delivers human-like, context-aware conversations that go beyond basic symptom checkers. Unlike conventional AI chatbots that provide one-size-fits-all responses, AutoMed's specialized agents work together to deliver precise, tailored recommendations based on the user’s health history and real-time input. This results in a more interactive, intelligent, and reliable medical consultation experience.\n",

    "# What is AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft that enables developers to orchestrate and optimize AI workflows using multiple AI agents. These agents can collaborate, automate decision-making, and dynamically generate responses in complex problem-solving tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional AI systems that work in isolation, AutoGen enables multiple AI agents (LLMs such as GPT) to interact, exchange information, and refine their outputs, making it more powerful and flexible for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features of AutoGen\n",
    "### 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen allows multiple AI agents to communicate and solve tasks collaboratively. Each agent can have a specific role, such as a problem solver, verifier, or optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One agent generates code, another reviews it, and another tests it.\n",
    "- A research agent collects information, while another summarizes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Conversational and Task-Oriented AI\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen supports LLM-driven conversations where AI agents engage in multi-turn dialogues to refine answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A chatbot that consults different AI agents, such as one for legal advice and another for finance.\n",
    "- A customer support AI that escalates unresolved queries to another AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Automated Workflow Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can orchestrate workflows for AI-driven automation, such as AI-assisted programming, research, and document generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automating software debugging where AI identifies issues, suggests fixes, and verifies solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Supports Human-AI Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen allows humans to intervene in AI-driven workflows by providing feedback or manually guiding agents when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A research assistant AI drafts a report, but a human expert refines it.\n",

    "For example, consider a patient experiencing persistent headaches and fatigue. Instead of offering generic advice, AutoMed intelligently activates multiple specialized AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patient Agent** – Collects user symptoms, medical history, and any ongoing treatments.\n",
    "2. **Symptom Analyzer Agent** – Evaluates potential conditions such as migraines, dehydration, or anemia based on AI-driven medical knowledge.\n",
    "3. **Pharmacy Agent** – Suggests remedies, over-the-counter medications, and when to seek professional medical attention.\n",
    "4.  **Consultation Advisor Agent** (Decides if a doctor visit is needed) – Fetches real-time updates from trusted healthcare medical research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agents work seamlessly together, analyzing, validating, and optimizing their recommendations to deliver the most relevant, personalized, and up-to-date medical guidance. The collaborative approach ensures that users receive a well-rounded medical consultation experience, similar to interacting with multiple healthcare professionals at once, but through an AI-driven, automated system.\n"

To ensure structured conversation flow, the consultation_agent includes a termination condition by adding \"CONSULTATION_COMPLETE\" to its response, signaling the end of the consultation session. All agents are configured with the llm_config, which specifies the underlying language model (GPT-4) for processing responses.
